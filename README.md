# Box-Model
The goal of this exercise was develop a better understanding of how the box model works.
<br>
I did this by making two boxes with equal values for width, height, padding, border, and margins. One box used the standard box model while the second box used the alternative box model so that one appeared larger than the other.
<br>
Then, I duplicated the boxes and made them display with identical sizes by changing only the size values, not the model type.
<br>
One duplicated set was to make the smaller alternative model box match the size of the larger standard model box. The next set was opposite: make the large one match the size of the small one.
<br>
Had difficulty getting the text to be vertically centered inside of the box, so I will work on that next.
